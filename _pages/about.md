## Startup Stint
Tried my hands on starting a travel startup in 2014, which aimed to be a personal travel assistant and a one stop destination for all travel needs starting from travel planning to the actual travel.

Handled complete development process including architecture design, frontend and **django** backend.

## Skillset

After finish my undergrad Engineering at Anna University, Chennai in Computer Science, I started my professional career at 2012 as a Network Engineer at [AGC Networks](www.agcnetworks.com).
